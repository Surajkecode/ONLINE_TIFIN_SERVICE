To organize the provided information about the **Online Tiffin Service Management System** using Django, I'll structure it into sections for clarity:



### **Project Overview**
The **Online Tiffin Service System** is a Django-based web application designed to create an online portal for both vendors and customers. The system provides an interactive GUI that is easy to use and allows the administrator to manage the entire system from a single portal.

- **User Groups Management:** Manage different user groups.
- **Profile Management:** Admin can update their profile, change their password, and recover the password.

#### **Vendor Module:**
- **Dashboard:** Vendors can view all orders.

#### **User Module:**
- **Home Page:** Users can view available food in the Tiffin service and place orders.
